# authapp
basic application with users made with Node, Express, Passport &amp; MongoDB

This is a basic web app that has users that can be authenticated locally with an encrpyted password. I uploaded this because
it's a useful boilerplate if you want to build an application with Node & Express and want to dive into the more complex stuff.

The templating engine is Handlebars, the authentication is handled with passport, the database is MongoDB and the modeling is 
Mongoose, and Express & Node are the backbone. This isn't a MEAN app - a truly effective app would use Angular for the MVC, but 
if you just want to mess around this is perfect.

To get it started, download this package, and install all the packages. 

In database.js (inside the config folder), add your database credentials there. 

Start the server with node index.js and you'll be moving in no time.
